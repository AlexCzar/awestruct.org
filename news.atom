      Development on Awestruct is picking up now that the Arquillian team has
      started hacking on it for their new project site. They've contributed some
      improvements to Awestruct and have some other extensions waiting in the wings
      for a future release. There's also been a lot of chatter about Awestruct
      recently on twitter.
      
      Here's a taste of the treats in store for you.
      
      
      
      Aslak improved the Posts extension to read page.date as a alternative to
      the post filename, part of the preparation for a feature that enables
      automatic generation of blog entries for project releases (like this one!).

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uh, we skipped a few release announcements, but it's because...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Development on Awestruct is picking up now that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arquillian.org&quot;&gt;Arquillian&lt;/a&gt; team has
      started hacking on it for their new project site. They've contributed some
      improvements to Awestruct and have some other extensions waiting in the wings
      for a future release. There's also been a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/search/awestruct&quot;&gt;chatter&lt;/a&gt; about Awestruct
      recently on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Here's a taste of the treats in store for you.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://awestruct.github.com/awestruct.org/images/news/ontheprowl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cat on the prowl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/aslakknutsen&quot;&gt;Aslak&lt;/a&gt; improved the &lt;a href=&quot;http://awestruct.github.com/awestruct.org/extensions/posts&quot;&gt;Posts&lt;/a&gt; extension to read page.date as a alternative to
      the post filename, part of the preparation for a feature that enables
      automatic generation of blog entries for project releases (like this one!).&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Aslak also integrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ttilley/fssm&quot;&gt;FSSM&lt;/a&gt; to monitor files more efficiently in development
      mode. Your CPU will thank you! He also committed a fix for a divide by 0 bug
      in the tagger extension that would strike when you least expected it.
      Additionally, he added support for extensions to define their own
      transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojavelinux&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;'s request, Awestruct has been upgraded to &lt;a href=&quot;http://compass-style.org&quot;&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt; 0.11.5 to take
      advantage of all the latest CSS3 mixins and so the online Compass
      documentation is actually relevant for developers using Awestruct. If you've
      been using a lot of the CSS3 mixins already, you may need to do a little
      migration. Compass spits out deprecation warnings to the console. Holler if
      the upgrade breaks your stylesheet and you aren't sure how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Dan and Aslak figured out how to hack RedCloth to provide custom inline and
      block markup. The hooks are now in place. We'll be documenting how to make use
      of them soon. You can see an example
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com/blob/develop/_ext/textile_plus.rb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Dan documented the &lt;a href=&quot;http://awestruct.github.com/awestruct.org/extensions/disqus&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; extension, an extension which snuck into a
      previous release without much ado. He also added an option to have the
      extension generate the Disqus identifier automatically from the date and slug
      of the post. Disqus is an alternative JavaScript-based comment system for
      Awestruct &lt;a href=&quot;http://awestruct.github.com/awestruct.org/extensions/posts&quot;&gt;Posts&lt;/a&gt; which offers a very elegant interface for both users and
      administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/tombentley&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;'s gsub transformer finally got merged in, so you can slice and
      dice the pages as they exit the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Anyhow, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/awestruct/versions/0.2.7&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install awestruct&amp;#x000A;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;If I missed something, feel free to mention it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      Thanks to recent interest from Torsten Curdt, Emmanuel Bernard and others in the community,
      activity around Awestruct has increased as of late.
      
      Emmanuel gives us the Flattr extension, plus a really nice blog post.
      
      Torsten gives us RDiscount for Markdown instead of Bluecloth.  Holler if it breaks your stuff.
      
      Anyhow, check out v0.2.2.
