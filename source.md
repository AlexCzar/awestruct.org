<h1>Source</h1>
</div>

Source is kept on GitHub:

* <http://github.com/awestruct/awestruct/>

The source for the `awestruct.org` site is also available on GitHub:

* <http://github.com/awestruct/awestruct.org/>

The source for an example site generated with awestruct and published
on GitHub pages is also available.

* <http://github.com/awestruct/github_pages/>

<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>

Incremental builds are performed by 2 separate CI servers any time the code changes. 

* <a href="http://cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> generously supports project:odd and does a great job with <a href="https://projectodd.ci.cloudbees.com/job/awestruct/">our incrementals</a>.

* And of course, we couldn't really have the hipster cred we so crave without <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/awestruct/awestruct">our incrementals</a> being built on <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> as well.
